## One on Ones
My managers in the past rarely ever came to these meetings prepared unless it was to go over comp changes or unless there was some rare incidents to discuss with me. And so, unfortunately, I learned quite well and over a long period of time of what not to do in One on Ones. The other consistent pattern that I saw was that my managers often were late or by other actions, it seemed clear to me that it was not a high priority for them. 

Coming up with topics. Being prepared before day-of.
